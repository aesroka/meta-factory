New Feature Requirements - Customer Self-Service Portal
Client: TechFlow Industries
Date: 2024-01-25

---

## Background

TechFlow has an existing OrderFlow ERP system (legacy, Python 2.7) that handles internal order processing. They now want to add a customer-facing self-service portal.

## Discovery Notes (from stakeholder interviews)

### From Sarah Chen (CTO):
"Our customers keep calling to ask 'where's my order?' We spend 4 hours per inquiry just looking things up. If customers could see their order status themselves, we'd save at least 2 FTE worth of support calls."

### From Mike Rodriguez (Ops Manager):
"Last week a major customer threatened to leave because they couldn't get a straight answer about a delayed shipment. Our competitor has a portal - customers can see everything in real-time. We're losing deals over this."

### From Customer Support Team:
"We handle about 150 'where is my order' calls per day. Each one takes 15-20 minutes because we have to dig through three different systems. That's 40+ hours per day just answering the same question."

## Required Capabilities

1. **Order Status Tracking**
   - Customers can see all their orders
   - Real-time status updates
   - Estimated delivery dates
   - Shipping tracking integration

2. **Order History**
   - View past orders
   - Download invoices (PDF)
   - Reorder from history

3. **Account Management**
   - Update contact information
   - Manage shipping addresses
   - View account balance/credit

4. **Support Tickets**
   - Submit issues about orders
   - Track ticket status
   - Attach files/images

## Technical Constraints

- Must read from existing OrderFlow database (PostgreSQL 9.4)
- Cannot modify core OrderFlow system significantly
- Need to work around lack of API in legacy system
- Must support 500+ concurrent customer sessions
- SSO with customer's existing identity providers

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Order Status): 3 months
- Phase 2 (History + Reorder): 2 months
- Phase 3 (Account + Tickets): 2 months

## Budget

$400K total across all phases
