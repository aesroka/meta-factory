## Executive Summary

We need a self-service BI platform that consolidates data from our key business systems into unified dashboards. The goal is to have real-time visibility into sales pipeline, resource utilization, financials, and HR metrics in one place.

## Current Situation

Right now, getting a consolidated view of the business requires:
- Logging into HubSpot to check pipeline and deals
- Opening Hubplanner to see resource allocation and capacity
- Checking Atlas (our HR system) for headcount and leave data
- Downloading Excel reports from SharePoint for project tracking
- Exporting data from Xero to understand financials

This takes hours every week and the data is always stale by the time we compile it. Last month I spent an entire day just trying to reconcile our resource utilization against billable revenue - the numbers didn't match because they came from different systems at different times.

## Pain Points

1. **Time wasted on manual reporting**: Roughly 6-8 hours per week compiling data across systems
2. **Stale data**: By the time reports are compiled, they're already outdated
3. **No single source of truth**: Different systems show conflicting numbers
4. **Can't spot trends**: Without historical data in one place, we can't see patterns
5. **Reactive not proactive**: We find out about problems after they've happened

## Requirements

### Core Platform
- Apache Superset for visualization and dashboards
- AWS infrastructure (we already have an AWS account)
- Athena as the query engine (serverless, pay per query)
- S3 as the data lake storage

### Data Sources to Integrate

1. **HubSpot CRM**
   - Deals and pipeline stages
   - Companies and contacts
   - Activities and engagement
   - Revenue forecasts

2. **Hubplanner**
   - Resource bookings and allocations
   - Project assignments
   - Capacity and availability
   - Timesheet data

3. **Atlas (HR System)**
   - Employee directory
   - Leave balances and requests
   - Department structure
   - Start dates and tenure

4. **SharePoint Excel Files**
   - Project tracking spreadsheets
   - Budget vs actuals
   - Client satisfaction scores
   - Various ad-hoc reports

5. **Xero Accounting**
   - Invoices and payments
   - Revenue by client/project
   - Expenses and costs
   - Cash flow data

### Dashboards Needed

1. **Executive Dashboard**
   - Revenue vs target
   - Pipeline health
   - Utilization rate
   - Headcount trends

2. **Sales Dashboard**
   - Deal pipeline by stage
   - Win/loss rates
   - Forecast accuracy
   - Sales cycle length

3. **Resource Dashboard**
   - Utilization by person/team
   - Capacity vs demand
   - Bench time
   - Skills matrix

4. **Financial Dashboard**
   - Revenue by client
   - Profit margins
   - Outstanding invoices
   - Cash position

### Users and Access

- **Phase 1**: Single admin user (me) - full access to everything
- **Future**: Role-based access control
  - Integrate with Active Directory / Microsoft Entra ID
  - Exchange-linked email for notifications
  - Different permission levels (exec, manager, team member)

### Technical Constraints

- Must run on AWS (existing account)
- Budget-conscious - prefer serverless/pay-per-use
- I can do some technical work but not a full-time DevOps person
- Need to be maintainable by a small team

### Timeline

- Want something usable within 4-6 weeks
- Doesn't need to be perfect initially
- Can iterate and add data sources over time

### Budget

- Looking for a phased approach
- Phase 1: Core infrastructure + 2-3 key data sources
- Don't have a fixed budget but want to understand trade-offs

## Questions I Have

1. Should we use Superset's built-in connectors or build a proper ETL pipeline?
2. How do we handle API rate limits from HubSpot/Xero?
3. What's the best way to handle SharePoint Excel files - real-time or batch?
4. How do we ensure data freshness without breaking the bank on compute costs?
5. What's the upgrade path to multi-user with AD integration?
