Jordan: What’s the main pain point you want to tackle first?

Alex: Our drivers still get paper manifests. Dispatchers print them every morning. If a route changes, we have to reprint and sometimes drivers leave before the update.

Sam: The backend can push updates via API, but the field app doesn’t support dynamic manifest refresh. So we’re stuck with “print once at 6am.”

Jordan: How many drivers and dispatchers are we talking about?

Alex: About 80 drivers, 12 dispatchers. Each dispatcher handles a region.

Jordan: What would good look like?

Alex: Driver opens the app, sees today’s manifest, and it updates when we change the route. No paper. We’ve had compliance issues too—auditors want digital records.

Sam: We’d need the mobile app to subscribe to route updates and maybe offline support for areas with bad signal.

Jordan: Got it. So we’re looking at real-time manifest updates, fewer paper-based errors, and an audit trail.
