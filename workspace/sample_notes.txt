Technical notes – Acme field app

Current stack:
- Mobile: React Native (iOS/Android), last major upgrade 2 years ago
- Backend: Java/Spring Boot, REST API
- Auth: JWT; refresh tokens stored in app secure storage
- Manifest: generated by a separate “routing” service, consumed by backend then sent to app as static PDF/HTML

Gaps:
- No WebSocket or push channel for live manifest updates
- App assumes manifest is fixed at login; no “refresh” from server
- Offline: partial; cached manifest is read-only, no conflict handling

Possible directions:
- Add WebSocket endpoint for “manifest stream” per driver
- App: subscribe on login, apply diffs to local manifest, support offline queue of actions
- Backend: event when routing service publishes new manifest; fan-out to connected drivers

Risks:
- Legacy routing service has no event API; might need polling or a small adapter.
