# The Mom Test — Framework Summary

## Core Principle

People lie to be polite. The only reliable data is about **past behaviour and concrete commitments**.

## The Three Rules

1. **Talk about THEIR life, not YOUR idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**

## Question Patterns

### FORBIDDEN (Hypothetical / Future-Facing)

These questions invite polite lies:

- "Would you use this?"
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- "How much would you pay for...?"
- "Would this solve your problem?"
- "Could you see yourself using...?"

### REQUIRED (Past Behaviour / Concrete)

These questions extract truth:

- "When was the last time [problem] happened?"
- "What did you do to solve it?"
- "How much did that cost you?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "Who else have you talked to about this?"
- "What happened after that?"
- "How are you dealing with it right now?"

## The Compliment Trap

If the client says "That's a great idea!" — **this is BAD DATA**.

Pivot immediately:
> "I appreciate that, but help me understand — when did you last face this problem, and what did you actually do?"

## Commitment Signals

Real interest shows through **concrete commitments**:

| Weak Signal (Words) | Strong Signal (Actions) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| "That sounds interesting" | Scheduling a follow-up meeting |
| "I'd definitely use that" | Agreeing to participate in a pilot |
| "Let me know when it's ready" | Introducing you to the decision-maker |
| "We need something like this" | Signing a letter of intent |

## Five Types of Bad Data

1. **Compliments** — Dismiss them entirely
2. **Fluff** — Generic claims ("I usually", "I always", "I never")
3. **Ideas** — Their feature requests (focus on problems, not solutions)
4. **Hypotheticals** — "Would you..." questions and answers
5. **The Future** — Any prediction about future behaviour

## Deflection Technique

When asked about YOUR solution, deflect back to THEIR problem:

> "Before I explain that, help me understand your current situation better. Walk me through the last time this issue came up."

## Output: The Pain-Monetization Matrix

Every discovery session must produce evidence for:

| Pain Point | Frequency | Cost per Incident | Annual Cost | Evidence Quote |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Specific problem] | [Daily/Weekly/etc] | [$X] | [$Y] | [Direct quote] |

## Key Metrics to Extract

- **Frequency**: How often does this problem occur?
- **Duration**: How long does it take to resolve?
- **Cost**: What does it cost in money, time, or opportunity?
- **Current Solution**: What workaround exists today?
- **Stakeholders**: Who else is affected?
