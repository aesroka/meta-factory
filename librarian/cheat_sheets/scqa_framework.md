# SCQA Framework — Framework Summary

## Core Principle

Structure communication to **create engagement** by establishing context, introducing tension, and then resolving it with your recommendation.

## The SCQA Elements

| Element | Purpose | Typical Length |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Situation** | Establish shared context | 1-2 sentences |
| **Complication** | Introduce tension/problem | 1-2 sentences |
| **Question** | Focus attention | 1 sentence (often implicit) |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | 1 sentence + supporting detail |

## Why SCQA Works

1. **Situation**: Gets audience nodding ("Yes, I know that")
2. **Complication**: Creates interest ("Oh, that's a problem")
3. **Question**: Focuses mind ("How do we solve this?")
4. **Answer**: Satisfies curiosity ("Here's the solution")

## Crafting Each Element

### Situation

**What to include**:
- Facts everyone agrees on
- Current state of affairs
- Relevant background

**Good Situation statements**:
- "We currently serve 10,000 customers through our web platform."
- "Our team processes an average of 500 orders per day."
- "The company has used the legacy CRM for 8 years."

**Avoid**:
- Introducing new/controversial information
- Going too far back in history
- Being too detailed

### Complication

**What to include**:
- What has changed
- What problem exists
- What tension needs resolution

**Types of Complications**:
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Something changed** | "But order volumes doubled last quarter" |
| **Something went wrong** | "However, error rates reached 15%" |
| **New opportunity** | "Now there's a chance to enter a new market" |
| **Challenge emerged** | "Yet competitors are undercutting our prices" |

**Good Complication statements**:
- "However, error rates have increased to 15%, costing $50K monthly."
- "But the system can't scale beyond current capacity."
- "Yet we're losing deals because proposals take 2 weeks to produce."

### Question

**Characteristics**:
- Often implicit (doesn't need to be stated)
- Flows naturally from Situation + Complication
- Focuses on what the audience wants to know

**Common patterns**:
- "How can we [solve the problem]?"
- "What should we do about [the complication]?"
- "How do we [achieve goal] while [handling constraint]?"

**Explicit Question examples**:
- "How can we reduce errors while maintaining throughput?"
- "What's the best way to modernise the platform?"
- "How should we respond to this competitive threat?"

### Answer

**What to include**:
- Clear recommendation
- Immediately followed by supporting points

**Structure**:
```
[Recommendation statement]
Because:
1. [First reason]
2. [Second reason]
3. [Third reason]
```

**Good Answer statements**:
- "Implement automated order validation. This will reduce errors by 90%, save $45K monthly, and free staff for value-add work."
- "We should migrate to the cloud over 6 months. This is the fastest, lowest-risk path that meets our scale requirements."

## Complete SCQA Examples

### Example 1: Technical Proposal

**S**: "Our order processing system handles 500 orders daily with a team of 10 operators."

**C**: "However, manual data entry errors have reached 15%, costing $50,000 monthly in refunds and customer compensation."

**Q**: "How can we reduce errors while maintaining throughput?"

**A**: "Implement automated order validation with ML-powered data extraction. This will reduce errors by 90%, pay for itself in 3 months, and free operators for customer success work."

### Example 2: Project Update

**S**: "We're in month 3 of the 6-month platform migration."

**C**: "We've discovered the legacy API has 200 undocumented endpoints, not the 50 we estimated."

**Q**: (Implicit: What does this mean for the project?)

**A**: "We need to extend the timeline by 6 weeks and add one developer. This ensures quality while minimising schedule impact."

### Example 3: Strategic Recommendation

**S**: "We hold 30% market share in the domestic enterprise segment."

**C**: "But growth has stalled at 2% annually while competitors grow at 15% by targeting mid-market."

**Q**: "How should we reignite growth?"

**A**: "Launch a mid-market product tier. Research shows 40% of mid-market buyers want our features but can't afford enterprise pricing."

## SCQA Variations

### QSCA (Lead with Question)

For audiences who want to cut to the chase:

**Q**: "Should we migrate to the cloud?"

**S**: "Our on-prem infrastructure is 7 years old."

**C**: "Scaling requires $2M CapEx, and we can't find DevOps talent."

**A**: "Yes, migrate over 9 months using a lift-and-shift strategy."

### SCA (Implicit Question)

When the question is obvious:

**S**: "We promised the board 20% growth this year."

**C**: "We're tracking at 8%."

**A**: "We need to accelerate the new product launch and expand sales coverage."

## SCQA vs. Other Frameworks

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **SCQA** | Recommendations, proposals, persuasion |
| **STAR** | Behavioral interview answers |
| **BLUF** | Military/government communication |
| **PREP** | Quick arguments (Point, Reason, Example, Point) |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Situation too long | Loses audience | Keep to 1-2 sentences |
| No real complication | No tension, no interest | Find the genuine problem |
| Complication buried | Hard to follow | State it clearly |
| Answer doesn't resolve | Leaves audience unsatisfied | Directly address the question |
| Multiple complications | Confusing | Pick the most important one |

## Template for Proposals

```
SITUATION:
[1-2 sentences on current state everyone agrees on]

COMPLICATION:
[1-2 sentences on what's wrong/changed/challenging]

QUESTION:
[The question this raises - can be implicit]

ANSWER:
[Your recommendation in one clear sentence]

BECAUSE:
1. [First key reason with evidence]
2. [Second key reason with evidence]
3. [Third key reason with evidence]

THEREFORE:
[Specific next steps]
```
