# The Minto Pyramid Principle — Framework Summary

*Based on Barbara Minto's methodology*

## Core Principle

Start with the **answer first** (BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front), then provide supporting arguments in a logical structure. Readers/listeners should understand your main point immediately.

## The Pyramid Structure

```
                    [Main Point]
                   /     |     \
           [Key Point] [Key Point] [Key Point]
           /    \       /    \       /    \
      [Detail] [Detail] ...  ...   ...   ...
```

**Top-Down Delivery**: Present conclusion first, then supporting points, then details.

## The BLUF Principle

**Bottom Line Up Front**: Your most important message comes first.

### Before (Burying the Lead)
> "We analysed the market, looked at competitors, evaluated our capabilities, considered various options, and after much deliberation, we believe we should enter the Asian market."

### After (BLUF)
> "We should enter the Asian market. Here's why..."

## The SCQA Framework

Use for structuring any communication:

| Element | Purpose | Question It Answers |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Situation** | Establish common ground | What does the audience already know? |
| **Complication** | Create tension | What's changed? What's the problem? |
| **Question** | Focus attention | What question does this raise? |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | What's your solution? |

### Example

**Situation**: "We currently process orders manually."

**Complication**: "Error rates have reached 15%, costing $50K monthly."

**Question**: "How can we reduce errors while maintaining throughput?"

**Answer**: "Implement automated order validation."

## Grouping Arguments

### MECE Principle

**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlaps between groups
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Nothing left out

### Bad Grouping (Overlapping)
- "Improve quality"
- "Reduce defects"
- "Fix bugs faster"

### Good Grouping (MECE)
- "Prevent defects (upstream)"
- "Detect defects (testing)"
- "Fix defects (remediation)"

## Logical Ordering

Choose one of these orders for your supporting points:

| Order | Use When | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Time** | Sequence matters | Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 |
| **Structure** | Parts of a whole | Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure |
| **Importance** | Ranking matters | Critical, Important, Nice-to-have |
| **Deductive** | Proving a point | Premise → Premise → Conclusion |

## Building the Pyramid

### Top-Down Approach
1. Start with your answer/recommendation
2. Ask "Why?" or "How?" to generate supporting points
3. Group supporting points (MECE)
4. Continue breaking down until you reach facts

### Bottom-Up Approach
1. List all your data/observations
2. Group similar items
3. Find the "so what" for each group
4. Combine into main message

## Supporting Your Answer

Each supporting point should pass these tests:

1. **Does it directly support the point above?**
2. **Is it at the same level of abstraction as its siblings?**
3. **Is it logically distinct from its siblings?**

## The Rule of Three

Human cognition handles 3-5 items well. Structure your arguments in groups of 3:

```
"We should do X because:
1. It reduces cost
2. It improves quality
3. It saves time"
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Narrative style** | Buries the conclusion | Lead with answer |
| **Data dump** | No structure or synthesis | Group and summarise |
| **Kitchen sink** | Everything included | Focus on what matters |
| **Missing synthesis** | Points don't connect to conclusion | Add "so what" |
| **Overlapping points** | Not MECE | Restructure groups |

## Verbal Signposting

Use transitions to make structure clear:

- "There are three main reasons..."
- "First... Second... Third..."
- "The most important point is..."
- "In addition to X, we also need to consider Y..."
- "This brings us to the recommendation..."

## One-Page Summary Template

```
RECOMMENDATION: [Main message in one sentence]

WHY:
1. [First key reason]
   - [Supporting detail]
   - [Supporting detail]

2. [Second key reason]
   - [Supporting detail]
   - [Supporting detail]

3. [Third key reason]
   - [Supporting detail]
   - [Supporting detail]

NEXT STEPS: [Specific actions]
```

## Executive Summary Structure

1. **Situation** (1-2 sentences): Context everyone agrees on
2. **Complication** (1-2 sentences): The problem or change
3. **Resolution** (1 sentence): Your recommendation
4. **Key Supporting Points** (3-5 bullets): Why this is the right answer
5. **Next Steps** (2-3 bullets): What needs to happen now

## Output for Proposals

Every proposal section should:
1. Lead with its main point
2. Support with 3 key arguments
3. Provide evidence for each argument
4. Follow MECE grouping
